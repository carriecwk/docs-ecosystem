Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB Python
drivers. Add one of the following drivers to your application to work with
MongoDB in Python:

- :doc:`PyMongo </pymongo>` for synchronous Python applications

  - `PyMongoArrow <https://mongo-arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__, a
    PyMongo extension for loading MongoDB query result sets as Apache Arrow tables

- :doc:`Motor </motor>` for asynchronous Python applications

.. include:: /includes/university-m220p.rst

Compatibility
-------------

You can connect your application to deployments hosted in the following 
environments:

- `{+atlas+} 
  <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas?tck=docs_server>`__: The fully
  managed service for MongoDB deployments in the cloud
- :ref:`MongoDB Enterprise <install-mdb-enterprise>`: The
  subscription-based, self-managed version of MongoDB
- :ref:`MongoDB Community <install-mdb-community-edition>`: The
  source available, free-to-use, and self-managed version of MongoDB

To learn more about connecting your application to deployments hosted in MongoDB 
Atlas, see :atlas:`Connect via Your Application </driver-connection>`.
